                Hi! I’m Dunia Imara Goncalves — a creative, joyful, and community-centered content creator. I’m a mom of three, and I love sharing everyday family moments that feel magical, honest, and relatable. My background blends tech, and storytelling.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                I’ve worked as a software engineer, English as a Second language Instructor, group fitness instructor, and a bartender but my favorite job is being a mom. I create UGC that celebrates real-life parenting, meaningful brands, and joyful connection. My content is warm, wholesome, and designed to resonate with modern families — especially women and moms like me.
            </p>
